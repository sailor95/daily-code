# leet-code-2020

My strategy: Go through category tags, do 3 medium problem for each tag, if I can't solve that specific problem, then go to the easy related problem.

## Order

Phase 1:

- array
- string
- tree
- linked-list
- math

Phase 2:

- hash table
- graph
- two pointers
- heap
- sort

Phase 3:

- depth first search
- breadth first search
- dynamic programming
- greedy
- binary search
- backtracking

## Good ones for review

(TBD)

## Weirdly tricky ones

Array: 1277
